![Marielle Smith](images/IMG_1692.jpg)

I am a broadly trained ecosystem ecologist, driven to understand the fate of tropical forests in the face of global change. The forests of the Amazon basin constitute the worldâ€™s largest intact tropical rainforest and are critical to global climate function and biodiversity, as well as providing many other ecosystem services. But the future of these forests, and the carbon they contain, is highly uncertain. My work aims to resolve key uncertainties associated with the responses of tropical forest structure and function to climate change (high temperatures and drought), with an increasing focus on human-modified forests. I use a variety of approaches,
from remote sensing to field observations, within the context of large, international collaborations.

I am currently a Senior Research Associate at the Deptartment of Forestry, Michigan State University (USA) working in [Scott Stark's Tropical Forest Ecology lab](https://www.canr.msu.edu/people/sstark). In August (2022) I will start a Lecturership position in the Forest Sciences group at Bangor University (Wales, UK).
