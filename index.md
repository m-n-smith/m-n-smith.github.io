I am a remote sensing specialist at the USDA Forest Service.

I earned my [PhD from the Department of Geography, Environment, and Spatial Sciences at Michigan State University](http://geo.msu.edu/), as a member of [Dr. Kyla Dahlin's](http://geo.msu.edu/people/dahlin-kyla/) [ERSAM LAB](https://www.ersamlab.com/). I also earned my [B.S. in Resource Conservation](https://www.cfc.umt.edu/undergrad/rc/default.php) and a [certificate in GIS Science and Technologies](https://www.cfc.umt.edu/giscertificate/) from the [University of Montana's College of Forestry](https://www.cfc.umt.edu/default.php) in 2015. 

I strive to find practical solutions to natural resource conservation and management issues by utilizing my remote sensing and geospatial research, teaching, and work experience, as well as my background in field-data collection. Through a host of coding languages, software platforms, and field-based skills I enjoy working on complex projects, while bringing cooperators together to build capacity by utilizing my interpersonal and communication skills.
